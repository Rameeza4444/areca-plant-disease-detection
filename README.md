AI-based approach to detect areca plant diseases using drone imagery (WIP)
# 🌿 Arecanut Disease Detection – Work in Progress

This is an ongoing academic project focused on detecting diseases in arecanut leaves using drone imagery and deep learning. The aim is to support farmers with an affordable, AI-based crop health monitoring tool.

## 📍 Project Overview

The project is divided into three main phases:

1. **Aerial Image Capture**  
   - Drone was flown over a plantation to capture high-resolution images of arecanut trees  
   - Images will later be used to detect leaf diseases

2. **Drone CAD Modeling**  
   - A custom drone design was modeled in SolidWorks
   - This model reflects the camera position and structural design used for image capture

3. **(Upcoming) Deep Learning Model**  
   - A CNN-based classifier will be developed to detect leaf diseases  
   - The model will be trained on annotated aerial imagery
